  "Base Prompt": "Objective:\nYou will describe a single GUI action using two images per step:\n1) a ZOOMED-IN CROP (primary focus), and\n2) a FULL-SCREEN image (1920×1080) providing context.\n\nCrop semantics:\n• Click / Select → the crop shows a semitransparent red “X” centered on the target control.• Scroll (MouseWheel)/Hotkey/Type → NO semitransparent red X; frame the entire screen. \n• Drag (action == 'DragStart at') → crop shows a semitransparent red PATH indicating the drag route (best-fit). Tight framing (~25 px padding). Full image unchanged.\n\nHigh-Priority Rules:\n• Read the crop first, then the full screen.\n• Never include coordinates, file paths, or timestamps.\n• Observation must describe what is visually present—icons, text, glyphs, color, shape—and must be complete (no partial equations or truncated labels).Infer the actually name of the icon if possible. Describe the icon such that an operator with no prior knowledge of the icon can identify and select it correctly. \n respect the raw action string precedence when present: Drag > Type > Scroll > Click. \n • If the action text contains 'Type' (e.g., 'Type: BEIJING'), you MUST output a Type action (not a click), even if a semitransparent red X is present on the field.\n• If a semitransparent red X is present → the target is exactly the element under the X.\n• If a semitransparent red PATH is present → describe the start object/region, the direction of drag, and the destination or region the path leads to.\n• Use the Recent Steps Context (≤3) to maintain intent continuity; infer purpose rather than copy earlier text.\n• Respond strictly in JSON; no extra prose.\n\nOutput Fields:\n{\n  \"Observation\": \"Describe the cropped region first, then relevant full-screen context.\",\n  \"Think\": \"Explain the user's likely intention based on Observation.\",\n  \"Action\": \"Concrete operation: click / type / drag, etc.  For drag: 'Click-and-hold on <start>, drag along the shown path to <destination>, then release.'\",\n  \"Expectation\": \"What should happen immediately after the action.\"}\n\nMini-Example:\nInput image shows semitransparent red X on a purple Teams icon in the taskbar.\n→ Observation: identifies icon precisely.\n→ Action: \"Click the Microsoft Teams icon.\"\n→ Expectation: Teams window opens.\n\nChecklist before final output:\n✓ Crop described first?  ✓ No coordinates?  ✓ JSON valid?\n",
  "Deltas": {
    "Click": "ActionTypeDelta (Click): When a semitransparent red X is present, the target is exactly under the X. Identify whether the click is on: (a) a UI control (toolbar/menu/top area), (b) an object on the canvas, (c) a blank region (often flat color), or (d) a control point/handle. <MODIFIER_GUIDE> State the immediate UI response: selection, menu/dialog opening, entering edit mode, or tool/mode change.",
    "RClick": "ActionTypeDelta (Right Click): Determine where the click occurs (on object, special area, blank). Look for a context menu and summarize its option types (editing, view, object actions).",
    "DblClick": "ActionTypeDelta (Double Click): Identify target type—text (likely enters edit/caret), graphic (may open properties/special action), or blank area (might create a new item). Note any modifier effects if visible.",
    "MouseWheel": "ActionTypeDelta (Scroll): Determine direction and purpose. Up usually moves view up or zooms in; down moves view down or zooms out. Note modifiers (Ctrl→zoom; Shift/Alt→horizontal). Identify the scrollable region affected (page, panel, or canvas).",
    "Drag": "ActionTypeDelta (Drag): Use the semitransparent red PATH crop to describe start→direction→destination and distance/scale qualitatively. Determine purpose: move object, resize, select range/text, multi-select sweep, or panel adjustment. <MODIFIER_GUIDE> Action must be: \"Click-and-hold on <start>, drag along the shown path to <destination>, then release.\"",
    "Type": "ActionTypeDelta (Type): Describe the visible text entry area and what is being typed. If text is partially visible, infer likely purpose (e.g., search bar, form field). Mention whether it replaces existing content or appends to it. Do not convert to a click even if a semitransparent red X marks the field; the operation is typing."

  "Modifier_Guide": "Modifier guidance (use only if a modifier is actually involved): Shift—add to selection / constrain proportions / constrain direction; Ctrl—multi-select / special function / precise control; Alt—alternate mode / temporary tool / special functions."
