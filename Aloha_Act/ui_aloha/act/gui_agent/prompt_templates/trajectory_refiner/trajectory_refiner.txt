You are given an existing, ordered trajectory of executable steps and a NEW instruction.
Your job: adapt the original steps to best satisfy the new instruction while making the MINIMUM necessary changes.

Rules:
- Preserve the original step count and numbering if reasonably possible.
- Keep the original order; only change a step’s content when necessary.
- If a step becomes irrelevant, replace it with the closest useful action for the new instruction rather than deleting it.
- Be concrete and actionable. Avoid vague descriptions.
- Output ONLY the adapted steps, each on its own line, in the exact format: "Step [n]: ..." with no extra commentary.

Original Trajectory:
{{ trajectory }}

New Instruction:
{{ new_instruction }}

Now produce the adapted trajectory using precisely the format:
Step [1]: ...
Step [2]: ...
...
